# CodeEdit

A web based, open-source code editor for realtime collaborative programming.

Please note: CodeEdit is under active development and is **NOT** ready for production use. 

You can checkout a demo over CodeEdit [here](http://codeedit.achurch.me).

# Installation

If you'd like to setup your own CodeEdit instance, you'll first need to install the following...

    * nodejs
    * npm

Once you've got Nodejs and npm you'll need the following packages... 

    * npm install expressjs
    * npm install socket.io
    * npm install serve-favicon

After everything is installed, simply cd into the directory, run `nodejs server.js` and point your browser to `localhost` and you're good to go!
